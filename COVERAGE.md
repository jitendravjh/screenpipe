# Screenpipe Coverage

Screenpipe tracks coverage at two complementary layers:

- Tauri/WebDriver E2E coverage: real product UX and local API behavior by platform.
- Core engine coverage: Rust behavioral flow coverage across capture, audio, DB, accessibility, and engine crates.

These dashboards are behavioral maps, not a replacement for line or branch coverage.
Use them to see which product risks are represented, then layer runtime job
results and `cargo llvm-cov` data on top when judging release confidence.

## Dashboards

- E2E dashboard: [apps/screenpipe-app-tauri/e2e/COVERAGE.md](apps/screenpipe-app-tauri/e2e/COVERAGE.md)
- Core engine dashboard: [docs/coverage/CORE.md](docs/coverage/CORE.md)

## Refresh

From `apps/screenpipe-app-tauri`:

```bash
bun run coverage:all
bun run coverage:all:check
```

For core line coverage, install/use `cargo llvm-cov` and feed its JSON
summary into `coverage:core`; the core dashboard documents the exact command.
